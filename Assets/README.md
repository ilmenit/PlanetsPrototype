# Planets Prototype

"Planets Prototype" is a codename for a prototype of a 4x space strategy game done in Unity3D. It is an experimental project to test the game mechanics ideas without any graphical distractions. The game uses a text terminal output as a temporary frontend that can be replaced by other graphical interfaces later.
