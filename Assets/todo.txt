TODO
- fleet building as available commands
- acquire planet costs 4 energy instead of 1, because of influence spread?
- next-turn handling as a state so entering/exiting will work
- next-turn should be available command
- In map generation there should be always at least one near Space Object to supply something and one visible to drive exploration

Evaluation
- if can build main resource, do it
- if need to build main resource, choose then one you produce less


DONE:
- Add handling of terrain transformations
- Create Command (Action) concept and Available Commands - for Command pattern where everything that player can do will be a Command
-- Command concepts should highlight available options in case of nested menus
---- Game -> Map -> Planet -> Building -> Supporting
---- Game -> Research -> Invention
-- Could be available but not affordable
- research options as available commands
! fix - after execution of command always fillavailablecommands(), it is influencing what is available?
! fix - GetAvailable should include checking which cell
- finish moving transformation to commands
- finish moving research to commands
! fix - Multiplier in production vs supply line - e.g. housing. Supply line takes all output now.
- research button should change color according to availability
